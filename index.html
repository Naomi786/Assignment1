        <div><h3>About Me</h3>
        <p style="color: gray;">My name is Jasia. I am 23 and a BBA student. I am the only daughter of my parents. I go to my university everyday and very consistent and punctual in my class. I always prefer to do my work on time. I am a self driven and self motivated student. I am capable to do well under any stressfull circumstances. All work and no fun activities can make life dull so it is important to have some time for recreation and relaxation. A hobby is an activity that someones enjoys doing in their spare time. My hobbies are Reading, Travelling, Painting, Exploring different cuisins, Collecting stamps etc.</p> <p style="color: gray";>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. I potray myself as an individual who is deeply commited to growth and self-improvement. I am continuously exploring new horizons. Unleashing my creative side, I think outside the box.</p></div>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <div class="flex-container">
      <div><h3>Reading &#128218;</h3> 
        <p style="color: gray;">My favourite hobby is reading. I get so much satisfaction and feel good when I read something informative and positive. I have a large collection of books and I consider them my best friends. Recently I have read The Lady of Blossholme by H. Rider Haggard. This is an amazing novel by the writer. I suggest everyone grow a reading habit. It is good for our mental growth</p></div>
        <div><h3>Travelling &#127759;</h3>
        <p style="color: gray;">My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the ship yet. I love to travel without a group and without a guide, despite the fact that I often find ourselves in a difficult situation in unfamiliar places.</p></div>
        <div><h3>Painting &#127912;</h3>
        <p style="color: gray;">I like to make paintings of various types of things like mountains, lakes, animals, birds, trees, cities, people etc. When I start painting I forget everything and I engross in painting. I love painting since childhood. I love to paint pictures with different color combinations. I want to become an artist.</p></div>
